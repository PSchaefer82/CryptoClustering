# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Assignment

# Overview
Deploying unsupervised learning through Python to predict of various cryptocurrencies are affected by a 24-hour or 7-day cycle. Data will be analyzed from a scaled dataset and again from a PCA dataset for comparison.
Composite plots of elbow graphs and scatter plots are provided.

# Dependencies
•	Pandas

•	Sklean.cluster - KMeans

•	Sklearn.decomposition - PCA

•	sklearn.preprocessing – StandardScaler
